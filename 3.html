				<p><h4><a href="http://ronaldvarney.com/">ALL ABOUT SIMPLICITY</a></h4>
It is great to have white background since the design scope becomes very broad and flexible. Sans serif typefaces are very modern. The thickness of the typeface is very significant because it could ruin all the modern look when it gets thicker.

		<h4><a href="http://the-most.com/#wildcat/">ALL ABOUT HOVER</a></h4>
		This website has hover effects going on everywhere. The overall design looks really simple and minimal. Typefaces and typography are treated nicely using different types of typefaces, still having clean design. But it draws audience's attention more has the hover effects come to the place. They do not bother audience at all, fast loading, straightforward on purposes of hover effects.

		<h4><a href="http://www.alquimiawrg.com/#/home">all about parallax</a></h4>
		Parallax scrolling really interests audience. It could be very distracting or too loud depending on how much animation or color you have. However this website well managed to make the design very crisp and solid by just using black and white.

		<h4><a href="http://www.flatvsrealism.com/">all about parallax 2</a></h4>
		This time colors are very bright. It could've been very loud if this website relies on graphic design. The website is more about animation, which brings up the potential parallax scrolling has. It shows the story that animation has and let's audience concentrate on the performance shown on screen.

		<h4><a href="http://www.urbanobservatory.org/">all about parallax 3</a></h4>
		Optical illusion makes the background three-dimensional. The distinct division of foreground and background, and the use of parallax effect makes you move the image around separately with horizontal scrolls.

		<h4><a href="http://www.graffitigeneral.com/">all about exploration</a></h4>
		The loading page is quite interesting. Since this website is about graffiti, it shows the spray paint icon rotating. After the page is loaded, you can see the screen responds to your arrow keys. Have fun on exploring this website.

		<h4><a href="http://dougaitkenthesource.com/">all about exploration 2</a></h4>
		This website displays video in the background which makes the page very sophisticated. It has less chance to be flattened out in design aspects, and also attracts the audience's attention. Combination of very minimalistic, monochromatic(only white) typography and design goes well with the video displayed behind them.

		<h4><a href="http://celebratedesign.org/">all about interaction</a></h4>
		Celebrating the 100th anniversary of AIGA, they have uploaded many designs and illustrations on the website. There are many effects going on without any action that audience takes; for example, the underscore sitting next to "design that" constantly flickers and changes the color. After you click the arrow, you will see different images appearing in corners, which draws people's interests. This is another way to have an interaction with the audience. Website should not be boring even if the audience is not moving their cursors.
