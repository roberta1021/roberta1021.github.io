				<h4><a href="http://ronaldvarney.com/">ALL ABOUT SIMPLICITY</a></h4>
It is great to have white background since the design scope becomes very broad and flexible. Sans serif typefaces are very modern. The thickness of the typeface is very significant because it could ruin all the modern look when it gets thicker. Clear hierarchy is shown and the site doesn't seem empty at all even though it has few elements displayed.

		<h4><a href="http://the-most.com/#wildcat/">ALL ABOUT HOVER</a></h4>
		This website has hover effects going on everywhere. The overall design looks really simple and minimal. Typefaces and typography are treated nicely using different types of typefaces, still having clean design. But it draws audience's attention more has the hover effects come to the place. They do not bother audience at all, fast loading, straightforward on purposes of hover effects. Smooth transition values the site even more.

		<h4><a href="http://www.alquimiawrg.com/#/home">all about parallax</a></h4>
		Parallax scrolling really interests audience. That's the reason why many websites use parallax. It could be very distracting or too loud depending on how much animation or color you have. However this website well managed to make the design very crisp and solid by just using black and white. Everything staying in the certain grid, text placements were very stable even though they look like they're floating around.

		<h4><a href="http://www.flatvsrealism.com/">all about parallax 2</a></h4>
		Colors are very bright. It could've been very loud if this website relies on graphic design. There are some risks to take and I've seen very few designers who could fully bring up their potentials using various color palettes. However, this website is more about animation, not graphic design. Colors are harmonious and makes the website very strong. The website also brings up the potential parallax scrolling has. It shows the story that animation has and let's audience concentrate on the performance shown on screen.

		<h4><a href="http://www.urbanobservatory.org/">all about parallax 3</a></h4>
		Optical illusion makes the background three-dimensional. The distinct division of foreground and background, and the use of parallax effect makes you move the image around separately with horizontal scrolls. This is another step that many designers can take to develop their websites further. Whatever the photographs are, if it has foreground and background, they can use them, change them to three dimensional space to make them more sophisticated.

		<h4><a href="http://www.graffitigeneral.com/">all about exploration</a></h4>
		The loading page is quite interesting. Since this website is about graffiti, it shows the spray paint icon rotating. After the page is loaded, you can see the screen responds to your arrow keys. Have fun on exploring this website.

		<h4><a href="http://dougaitkenthesource.com/">all about exploration 2</a></h4>
		This website displays video in the background which makes the page very sophisticated. It has less chance to be flattened out in design aspects, and also attracts the audience's attention. Combination of very minimalistic, monochromatic(only white) typography and design goes well with the video displayed behind them.

		<h4><a href="http://celebratedesign.org/">all about interaction</a></h4>
		Celebrating the 100th anniversary of AIGA, they have uploaded many designs and illustrations on the website. There are many effects going on without any action that audience takes; for example, the underscore sitting next to "design that" constantly flickers and changes the color. After you click the arrow, you will see different images appearing in corners, which draws people's interests. This is another way to have an interaction with the audience. Website should not be boring even if the audience is not moving their cursors.

		<h4><a href="http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2012/centuryofthechild/">all about interaction2</a></h4>
		MoMa website lets the viewer interact by hovering over each categories they have. The animation, a boy in the center keeps moving which makes this website more special and fun. The overall mood of the website definitely gives viewers the impression that it is about art. The first loading image also reminded me of canvas and paint. After the page is loaded, every time you hover on to the different sections, the circle in the center would change the color.

		<h4><a href="http://codepen.io/Xpressive_Team/full/tDHgb/">all about innovation</a></h4>
		This innovative design uses only CSS to make 3D car animation. Cars constantly moves around the green field; both cars and field also shows the three dimensional spaces by rotating the objects and zooming in our out of the objects. It shows that complicated codes can be styled not only with javascript, but also with CSS.

		<h4><a href="http://codepen.io/jlwebart/full/JDHne/">all about innovation2</a></h4>
		This demonstration also uses CSS and html5 to show this creative effect. As the one above, it seems to have similar effects, 3d iphone rotating. However, it also plays a video on the screen, which also rotates responding to the rotation that the phone makes.

		<h4><a href="http://trendland.com/">all about smoothness</a></h4>
		This website requires vertical scrolling throughout the page like any other websites. The main page starts with a slideshow on top, and their logo and navigation bar on the bottom. However, as you scroll down, you can see the navigation bar sticks on top smoothly so it stays fixed on the window. It moves down again when you scroll up till the slideshow appears. This effect gives designers more various range of designing the web, since they can place the navigation bar anywhere else then just the top.

		<h4><a href="http://www.mustasj.no/">all about smoothness2</a></h4>
		The slideshow is very smooth. It speeds up while the picture is coming in, and slows down at the very end. It lets the viewers' eyes comfortable.

		<h4><a href="http://woodwork.nl/">all about design</a></h4>
		Unlike usual websites, this website requires horizontal scrolling to look through the items they displayed. Also, instead of scrolling, the viewers only need to hover over to the right side of the window; it will automatically scroll, showing the items that were hidden on the right. The only discomfort I feel is that I'm not the one who's in full control of scrolling.

		<h4><a href="http://www.isseymiyakeparfums.com/en/experiences/">all about design2</a></h4>
		The loading page was really interesting. A quick slideshow was shown in the middle with a pause button overlapped. The overall design seemed very clean. There weren't any effects or navigation that misleads the viewers into different direction. I really liked how the website were built monochromatic and stark.
